##Supervised Learning

###Regression:
where the output is drawn from a continuous function (Curve / Straight line)
**Ex:** Estimating the selling price given the sq.fts of house. Where price is a continuous value

###Classification:
where the output is to categorize into given set of discrete values
**Ex:** Identifying if the cancer is type1 or type2 given the tumour size. Where the cateogires type1 or type2 can be represented with discrete values like 0, 1

##Unsupervised Learning

###Clustering:
Given no labelling on the data. Yet the algo, groups related items into the same category
**Ex.** Google news clustering the related links under one news article

###Non-Clustering:
**Ex.** Separation of two overlapping musics. Removing BGM from a song
